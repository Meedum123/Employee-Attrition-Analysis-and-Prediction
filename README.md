## 📚 Overview

This project explores, predicts, and simulates employee attrition at **Atlas Labs**, based on workforce data.  
Starting from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to building **machine learning models**, we finally created a **functional admin panel simulation** to predict individual attrition risk and suggest interventions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand why employees leave  
- Predict attrition early  
- Simulate real-world HR decision support using data science  

---

## 🚀 Project Phases

### 🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified key attrition patterns: **young**, **single**, **recently promoted** employees leaving early  
- Highlighted risk factors: **salary gaps**, **overtime**, **business travel**  
- **Techniques** used:
  - Chi-Square Test
  - Mann-Whitney U Test
  - Correlation Analysis
  - Feature Engineering

### 🤖 2. Predictive Modeling
- Models built:
  - ✅ XGBoost (**Best Performance**)
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
- **Test Accuracy**: 87% (XGBoost)
- **Top Features** (by importance):
  - Overtime
  - Business Travel
  - Years Since Last Promotion
  - Salary
  - Stock Options
  - Travelling
  - Marital Status

### 🖥️ 3. Attrition Risk Simulation Product
- Developed a simulated **Admin Dashboard**
- **Key Features**:
  - Add new employee data and instantly predict attrition risk
  - Filter risk by department, state, and job role
  - Suggest personalized retention actions for high-risk employees
  - Simulate the impact of:
    - Salary increases
    - Travel reductions
    - Overtime changes

---

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Discovered **hidden patterns** influencing early attrition  
- Built a model to forecast **employee risk at onboarding**  
- Created a simple dashboard to inspire **HR decision support**  
- Emphasized **data-driven understanding** over assumptions  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, R, PHP, HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE  
- **Statistical Tools**: Chi-Square Tests, Mann-Whitney U Test, Correlation Analysis  
- **Web Stack**: Flask (Python backend), PHP (admin simulation)  
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
